# Gork-Clyde
Gork &amp; Clyde is a 3D local co-op puzzle platformer about two different and unique Aliens exploring a flying abandoned temple to find the construction plans of an unknown anti-gravity system. Made as a student project in a 9 man team during my second semester at the S4G School for Games GmbH.
